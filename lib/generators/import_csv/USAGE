Description:
    Generates controllers, views, helpers, decorators and javascripts for csv imports which you can later customize.
    The views and controllers are already namespaced under CsvImports / csv_imports.
    You can prefix them with namespace such as admin then the resulting namespace would be admin/csv_imports.
    Javascript file for async indexing is not namespaced by default, you can define the namespace for that.
    Helpers and decorators will not be namespaced.
    The generator also generates an example - companies import to get you started on how to use the engine.

Example:
    rails generate import_csv admin common

    This will create:
        what/will/it/create
