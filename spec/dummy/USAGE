Description:
    Generates initializer, controllers, views, helpers, decorators, javascripts and example strategy for csv imports which you can later customize.
    First argument defines model that you want to import.
    The views and controllers are already namespaced under CsvImports / csv_imports.
    You can prefix them with namespace such as admin then the resulting namespace would be admin/csv_imports.
    The same prefix admin will be used to namespace helpers.
    To generated no namespace do not specify argument or provide it as "none".
    Javascript file for async indexing is not namespaced by default, you can define the namespace for that.
    Helpers and decorators will not be namespaced.
    The generator also generates an example - companies import to get you started on how to use the engine.
    Generating second model import please use --skip-skeleton option

Example:
    rails generate import_csv model_to_import controller_namespace javascript_namespace
    rails generate import_csv Scheme admins common
    rails generate import_csv Scheme admins --skip-skeleton

    This will create:
        config/initializers/import_csv.rb
